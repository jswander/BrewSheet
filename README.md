# BrewSheet
Homebrew beer recipe software and database written in LibreOffice Basic

Create an empty debug.log in dir with the spreadsheet.
Must enable macros.
Must define database. Brief instruction on calc sheet.

There are few background images I need to upload but it should work as is.

Still a work in progress, some known issues.

Most development with LibreOffice on Linux Mint with some testing w/ LO on Win 8.1 under VirtualBox and some on OpenOffice on Win 10 native.
